## How to open a jupyter notebook

The computer in computer barn connected with the virtual environment of campus server. Therefore you can't access the the ipynb file in the desktop. I recommend that you read the ipynb file on your own computer.

If you don't have jupyter, [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) is recommended. Find appropriate version and add the path to your PATH.

For linux: `echo $PATH` to see your path

For windows: computer ->  properties -> advanced setting -> environment variable

For Mac: I don't use Mac.



You can also use `conda` or `pip` to install jupyter.

### For Windows:

- search for `anaconda prompt ` . If none, search for `spyder`  and open it contained folder. You will find  `anaconda prompt `  there.
- change directory to the file root folder:`cd /path/to/your/file/PythonIO/`
- type in `jupyter notebook`

### For Linux

- Open  up a terminal 
-  `cd /path/to/your/file/PythonIO/`
- type in `jupyter notebook`
